It’s a [heat wave](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-los-angeles-september-heat-wave-20140915-htmlstory.html) — not tropical, but desert — that has covered Los Angeles. Clear skies, bright azure and cloudless, let the sun beat down with a blinding, white light, against our treeless wide gray streets and square-roofed blocks of apartments. Hardly a breath of wind comes in off the ocean. My wife pours with sweat, my co-workers arrive at work with pink cheeks and damp foreheads; everybody dreads going out for lunch. And, being a dad, I dread the idea that my son might get left in a hot car. Which is why we found a failsafe that is effective and adorable.

We live near the beach, and we live there on purpose — that fresh beach air can make it as much as ten degrees cooler. For six summers, we haven’t wished for an air conditioner. Now, [temperature records fall](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-los-angeles-heat-wave-20140916-story.html) right and left. My wife and I swelter at night with three fans on us, laying on top of a cotton sheet that’s just too thick. The dog flees the bed — we’re too hot, too close for him — and sleeps on the hard wood floor. The baby’s bedroom is the coolest, but even he sleeps in just a onesie, with the fan turned up high, and my eagle eye on the temperature gauge on [his baby monitor](http://www.kaizendad.com/irresistible-television-baby-monitor/).

Every weekday, in the morning, my son goes to daycare. And, at the end of the day, I get in my black sedan, parked in an open lot, sitting under that white-hot sun all day, and feel the scorch of the hot leather, the sear of the hot steering wheel, the burn of air heated in a ninety-degree oven for eight hours, and dread the idea that my son might get left in a hot car.


## I fear leaving my son in a hot car

I know [it’s not awful parents who leave their children in hot cars](http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/fatal-distraction-forgetting-a-child-in-thebackseat-of-a-car-is-a-horrifying-mistake-is-it-a-crime/2014/06/16/8ae0fe3a-f580-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html), which makes it all the worse. I’m forgetful enough at my best, despite all good intentions. At work or at home, I write down every to-do and make sure it goes on my master list, or it doesn’t get done. Yes, that includes taking my multivitamin, or any honey do task, or calling my parents.<sup id="rf1-575">[1](#fn1-575 "Yes, I’m that kind of son; I need a note to myself to call my parents. Fortunately, I married the kind of woman who reminds me to do just that.")</sup>

If I could forget to clean the dishes, or buy milk, or my haircut if it weren’t on my calendar, could I forget my son in the car? I think so. And, if I could forget my son in the car because of a simple oversight, could anyone? How do we plan for the eventual human failing? How do we plan for the fact that I will inevitably be an idiot, other than hoping to luck that this is not the specific way in which I am an idiot?

## The Hot Car, Safe Baby Habit
![](/content/images/2016/04/IMG_0045-1.jpg)

The only way to beat my eventual idiocy is to have some double-check built into the system, something that will ensure that the baby is safe even when I fail at my primary job, when I finally do not keep my son safe like every father should. I need something that happens every day, whether or not I drop the baby, and that fails loudly when I would otherwise fail quietly. I need a nice, public habit.

And the only kind of habits that stick are those that are fun. So, in order to not do something privately abysmal, I need to do something publicly joyous. You know what’s joyous? Babies. If you’re a parent, the only thing more joyous than a baby is the *baby photo*.

So my habit, to keep from leaving my baby in the hot car, is to take a photo of the baby every time I drop him off at daycare. If my wife doesn’t get a photo by about drop-off time, she texts and asks after the baby. It even works in reverse — if she drops him, I get the photo or check in myself. They’re *baby photos*, they’re adorable!


The big benefit of this is that I now have a picture of the baby practically every weekday in the 13 months since he started at daycare. I can watch him grow up in front of my eyes, again and again. And, hopefully, I can be confident that he will finish growing up, and never get locked in that hot car.
