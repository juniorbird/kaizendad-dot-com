I used to have this parrot named Junior. One day, we were sitting out in the backyard of this place we used to live — him in a tree, me on a chair, a dozen feet away. All of a sudden, from out of nowhere, a hawk swept down on him, talons outstretched. I could only think “nooooooo” in my mind as I saw my beloved pet about to be snatched away and carried to his inevitable death. But, when the hawk was inches away, suddenly Junior puffed out his feathers and spread his wings and became very big, and that scared the hawk, who stopped in midair and flew away, never to return. I ran over to Junior, grabbed him and held him, and was shocked to discover that, as my heart was pounding, he seemed… totally normal. Unconcerned. Not even amped up. He had beaten off the attack; he had no need to worry.

It’s tempting to say “my son almost died.” But that’s not true. The almost-death thing that so many parents trot out is nothing but worry, which is itself a [muda](/glossary#muda).
