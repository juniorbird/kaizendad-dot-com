We have this little dog, Charley, whom we rescued about 3 years ago. Charley is tiny and adorable, and lives his life perched on soft pillows, nestled under warm blankets, and with two square meals of food a day, supplemented with abundant treats, fish oil for his coat and skin, and, now whatever the baby drops. Charley is also very, very broken: he has a hole in his heart that he’ll never fill. For every day of his life, he’ll wonder if he’s loved enough, and be scared he’ll be kicked and hit, or just left alone forever.

Poor Charley has a hole in his hear that he’ll never fill. He was abused as a baby puppy and now he’s scared of everything, and lonely, and needs to be held and loved. All because, for the first 18 months of his life, this little dog didn’t get enough.

And then I was buying stuff at the CVS, and there was this homeless woman behind me, buying cigarettes, and there was another guy buying pampers, and she said she could never do that, she’d overprotect the baby, make him wear goggles, she said it over. She said that she’d overprotect the baby and he’d resent her. Just like her dad, who always told her to shut up.

It’s amazing what a hole you can leave in a person if you don’t rest them well as a little one.
