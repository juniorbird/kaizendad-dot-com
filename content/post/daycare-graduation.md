+++


It’s happened again; the baby has graduated from a daycare classroom, and moved on to a new room, with bigger kids, bigger toys, and bigger activities. Now, at eighteen months, he plays outside every day, eats at the same time, takes his naps on a mat — it’s pretty grown-up stuff! Of course, it seemed pretty grown-up stuff when he moved from his first classroom and started to walk every day. Now we just take that for granted.

The new classroom is much more mature than the old one. My son is now:  
 * Fed on a schedule, instead of whenever he wants  
 * Napping on a schedule, instead of whenever he’s tired  
 * Sleeping on a mat, instead of a cozy crib  
 * Participating in planned activities, like “painting” on Wednesday and “water table and sea creatures” on Thursday, instead of free play all day  
 * Sitting down at a little table to eat, instead of being strapped into a high chair

This is a lot of change!

It’s tempting to want to hold my baby back — keep him from those big, tall kids who tower above him, and let him sleep in a crib and have bottles and play on his own schedule. When he graduated from his first daycare classroom, I was heartbroken. He’d stayed there practically every weekday from three to nine months, and it felt like home. I caught myself standing outside his old room, looking in, and sighing nostalgically. I wanted to hold him back then, too, to let him crawl and roll and play on his back on the floor and be held all day long.

In the very same way, I looked back into his second classroom, seen the little babies in their high chairs; the soft blankets in their cribs; their big diaper backsides in the air as they crawled; the bottles of milk, like the one we couldn’t separate our son from.

But the amazing thing about a toddler is how much you can see them grow. And, even in the first day in his new classroom, I could see that. On that very first day, he drank his milk from a cup like the big kids around him. He didn’t even want to touch that bottle.

He understood how to be cool fast.

And he was so inspired to move forward, to run around outside all day long and play with the big kid toys. It was exciting for him to change his behavior immediately, because he was already ready.

That’s part of what I love about daycare: my son is pushed to grow up and learn new things. Every time he sees a big kid do something — drink from a cup, sit at the big table, play with a toy correctly, and even talk — he tries it. And, most often, he succeeds.

Kaizen is fundamentally about continuous improvement, and these challenges help my son improve continuously. I couldn’t be prouder. Or more nostalgic for the sweet little days when he cuddled all day long, on his back, laughing at the playset above him and getting held by the sweet teachers in level one.
