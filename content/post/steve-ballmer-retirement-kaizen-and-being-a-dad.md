As I say in [the About page](http://www.kaizendad.com/who-is-wade-armstrong/), I got into Kaizen because of my experience building products. Learning about Kaizen and the related Lean techniques to build cool things changed how I think about not only work, but really how I approach a wide range of problems in my life. I specifically build technology products, and one of the biggest technology product companies out there — you may have heard of them — is Microsoft. You may have also heard that about their CEO [Steve Ballmer’s retirement](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2423498,00.asp).

That got me thinking about Microsoft as a product company, and what their performance could tell me about how I should be thinking about product development — and, by extension, thanks to the philosophy of this blog, being a dad and raising my baby. While Ballmer did a tremendous job with [Microsoft’s financial performance](http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/MSFT/financials), the reality is that his tenure has left the company in a very weak product position. When he came in, Windows and Office ruled the computing world; now, the company is badly behind with products like Windows Mobile, Surface, XBox Music, Windows 8, and even arguably Azure. Microsoft made good money, but they didn’t make good products. What can I learn from their missteps, and how can I apply it to being a dad?

Microsoft has aimed to, and failed to, launch major, all-at-once product improvements again and again.
