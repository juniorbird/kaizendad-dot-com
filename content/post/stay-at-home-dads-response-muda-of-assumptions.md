Stay-at-home Dads: they’re not as exotic now as [Mr. Mom](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=solr1W5idNY), but they’re exotic enough that it seems like every media mention of them needs to say that they’re not as exotic as Mr. Mom. Now that I’ve made that mandatory mention, I should clarify that I’m not Mr. Mom — for the moment, the wife is home with the baby. But, the important thing is that we actively considered who should be at home with the baby, and didn’t engage in the wasteful cultural presupposition of whom would be providing childcare.

Maybe it’s because I’m in that very-modern 28% of men whose wife earns more than them that I feel it’s wasteful to assume that mom should stay at home. But, then, even before I met my lovely wife I thought it was a waste, and hated it when I’d find out someone I was dating wanted nothing as much as to be a stay-at-home mom. Not because I didn’t approve of staying at home — it’s great for the kid — but because I didn’t approve of the assumption that it should be mom.

Kaizen talks about the waste of prework — and this seems like prework to me. Prework is often wasted because it removes the ability to respond to emerging needs and, instead, locks the organization into its assumptions. That seems like a good description for the waste that goes on as individuals build their dreams around working or staying at home with kids — who knows what’s best, yet? Why not dream of both?

Now, is my wife better-equipped to take care of the family? Sort of, at least right now — she’s the only one who can breastfeed, for instance. And that, very legitimately, may drive a lot of early decisions about who works and who doesn’t.
