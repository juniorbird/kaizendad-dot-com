I’m a pretty experienced traveler, but I’m scared of flying with baby. We’ve got a big trip coming up, and I’m quaking in my boots, with my poor wife having to put up with an even more irritable, cranky husband. I presume it must be the unknown — with a five-month-old on a plane, how many things can go wrong at once? Oh, the terror!

What’s weirdest is that my parents set a great example for me — I was flying well before I was 1. I know it can be done, and it can even be pulled off with a colicky, unhappy baby like me — to say nothing of the happy, laughing, friendly baby I get to have. Yet, for some reason, this trip intimidates the heck out of me.
