The poor baby has a cold. Being only 3 months old, he can’t blow his own nose. So – even poorer baby – he needs to deal with us sucking out the snot with this bulb syringe. Nothing says “I’m a good dad!” like sticking something up your baby’s nose and sucking until he wails! I’ve got to man up and use the [NoseFrida](http://www.fridababy.com/).
