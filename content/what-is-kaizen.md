*Kaizen* is a Japanese approach to manufacturing quality stuff that focuses on continuous improvement, not perfection. It focuses attention on where the real work is done; identifies the constraints and obstacles to getting work done; and finds ways for the people who do the real work to have the power to avoid those problems.

*Kaizen* was developed and popularized as part of the Toyota Production System, the set of manufacturing management techniques that Toyota used to become the #1 carmaker in the world. TPS also formed part of the foundation of what’s now called “lean manufacturing.”

And that’s where I come in. I first encountered lean in the early part of the ’00s, as I learned about Agile software development techniques. By 2006, I was using the Scrum flavor of Agile to manage product development and sales for my start-up. The principles of is approach, as popularized in the modern American tech industry, are broadly applicable to management and even to individual productivity. Best of all, they’re reasonable, people-focused, practical, and measurable.

So, when my most important product turned out to be in development, I thought: how can I use what I know about making good things to make one very important good thing? So I began to study *Kaizen*, the root of Agile. This is the story of how I apply this decade of lessons, and what new things I learn, as a dad and as a software engineer. But mostly as a dad.

Each entry includes some application of *Kaizen* thought, and there’s also a glossary of what key terms mean. And I try not to be too stuffy about all this all.
