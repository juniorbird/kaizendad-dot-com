I've had a surprisingly negative reaction to [Bernie Sanders](https://berniesanders.com/) for the past few months. I went on an extremely rare unsolicited Facebook rant on a friend's page when he posted some Bernie-related content[^1], and I've nearly dropped out of following the election out of desire not to get frustrated over the Sanders campaign. I'm even more _angry_ about Sanders than I am about Trump.[^2]

So why does Bernie Sanders make me so angry? [A podcast I was listening to recently](http://cucatholicctr.org/2016/06/the-sacrament-of-reconciliation-and-mercy/) suggested I ask "what are you avoiding with this anger?" What am I avoiding dealing with about Bernie? 

I think it comes down to three things, which I'm hoping to understand/fix by writing about here:

1. Entitlement to results vs. working for results
1. Determination to engage in "big bang" change, vs. incrementalism
1. Minimization of achievements of others
1. Disappointment in new policy creation

## New Policy Creation

Let's talk about the last one first, because it provides a useful platform to talk about this whole to-do. I'm generally pretty far to the left, although perhaps a bit more to [the anarchist left](http://amzn.to/28KP7yi) than the statist left.[^3]

As such, I was quite excited when Bernie initially decided to get and stay in the presidential race. Democratic Socialism is a well-proven approach that deals effectively with a wide range of societal and state issues.[^4]



[^1]: To expand on that, I nearly said "shilled some content for Bernie" here
[^2]: This may be extra-insane because I think Trump will win in the fall. It's possible, however, it's less-insane because I'm trying to learn to be blasé in the face of complete national disaster, because what else can one do?
[^3]: I don't say anarchist vs. socialist because anarchy is a form of socialism. Sorry, right-wingers, time to get with reality.
[^4]: It's also highly-identified — and, to a great extent, an outgrowth of — Catholic and mainline Protestant traditions in Europe, in contrast to how the American right typically portrays it.
