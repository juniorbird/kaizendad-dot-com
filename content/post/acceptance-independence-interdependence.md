Integration takes the distinct parts of your brain and helps them work together as a whole... Just as with the healthy functioning of the body, your brain can’t perform at its best unless its different parts work together in a coordinated and balanced way.

It’s easy to see when our kids aren’t integrated— they become overwhelmed by their emotions, confused and chaotic. They can’t respond calmly and capably to the situation at hand. Tantrums, meltdowns, aggression, and most of the other challenging experiences of parenting— and life— are a result of a loss of integration, also known as dis-integration.

horizontally integrated, so that their left-brain logic can work well with their right-brain emotion. We also want them to be vertically integrated, so that the physically higher parts of their brain, which let them thoughtfully consider their actions, work well with the lower parts, which are more concerned with instinct, gut reactions, and survival.

Shy children whose parents nurture a sense of courage by offering supportive explorations of the world tend to lose their behavioral inhibition,

A simple way to express it, though, is to describe mental health as our ability to remain in a “river of well-being.” Imagine a peaceful river running through the countryside. That’s your river of well-being.

very young children are right-hemisphere dominant, especially during their first three years. They haven’t mastered the ability to use logic and words to express their feelings, and they live their lives completely in the moment—

We don’t want our children to hurt. But we also want them to do more than simply get through their difficult times; we want them to face their troubles and grow from them.

Because neurons that fire together wire together, we create certain mental models based on what’s gone on in the past.

how do we help our children when they’re suffering from the effects of past negative experiences? We shine the light of awareness on those implicit memories, making them explicit so that our child can become aware of them and deal with them in an intentional way.

When we don’t offer a place for children to express their feelings and recall what happened after an overwhelming event, their implicit-only memories remain in dis-integrated form, leaving the children with no way to make sense of their experience.

when you give your children lots of practice at remembering— by having them tell and retell their own stories— you improve their ability to integrate implicit and explicit memories.

our mind can be pictured as a bicycle wheel, with a hub at the center and spokes radiating toward the outer rim. The rim represents anything we can pay attention to or become aware of:

The hub is the inner place of the mind from which we become aware of all that’s happening around and within us. It’s basically our prefrontal cortex,

Stuck on rim points? You can get confused if you "feel" or if you "are"

The danger is that the temporary state of mind can be perceived as a permanent part of their self. The state comes to be seen as a trait that defines who they are.

Need to help my child not feel the Dependence or the Counter-Dependence when he feels bad, not internalize it

And me too!

Take time to ask kids how they feel, and help them be specific, so they can go from vague emotional descriptors like “fine” and “bad” to more precise ones, like “disappointed,” “anxious,” “jealous,” and “excited.”

Mindfulness - note my thoughts, feelings.
Teach my son to note his

When interacting with our kids, it can be extremely helpful to decipher whether they’re in a reactive or receptive state of mind. This of course requires mindsight on our part... Wait until this reactive state passes; then, when she’s more receptive, talk to her about how you’d like to see her respond the next time she’s disappointed... In moments of reactivity, nonverbals (like hugs and empathetic facial expressions) will be much more powerful.

How to be of god
when parents offer repeated, predictable experiences in which they see and sensitively respond to their children’s emotions and needs, their children will thrive— socially, emotionally, physically, and even academically.

Rather than ignoring their big emotions or distracting them from their struggles, you can nurture their whole brain, walking with them through these challenges, staying present and thus strengthening the parent-child bond and helping your kids feel seen, heard, and cared for.
