We live in Southern California, where it’s always summer; but, even in Southern California, some times of the year are more summer than others. August is hot, the sun bright, the skies cloudless; our broad, concrete boulevards reflect scorching air, and the light, occasional breeze hardly drives away the bright white sunlight. There’s a reason we have a beach culture, and our 80-degree, no humidity desert summer days are that reason.

A Southern California toddler should, of course, be a beach toddler. The sand out here is perfect, soft, easy to run in, easy to play in. The water is cold, but not too cold by August. Just ten minutes away, down a long road through wetlands’ tall grass and around a bend, is the quiet north end of [Dockweiler Beach](http://southerncaliforniabeaches.org/playadelrey_dockweiler.php). There’s parking — worth more than gold, by the beach in summer — behind some condos, near an inlet, and even an ice cream truck driving past.

But the beach — the beach is new. Our toddler was too little last year in the summer, too little to walk on the beach himself or even sit in a carriage not covered from the sun. We wanted him to meet the beach, to learn how soft the sand was, how beautiful the water, and to see the people playing and the birds cavorting and all the seaweed that floats in at the tip of the waves. But [my toddler turned one](http://www.kaizendad.com/big-one/) in the winter, so this summer seemed time to start. We waited for the right weekend, and finally took that trip to the neighborhood beach.

My wife and I had happy visions of a beach toddler running in the sand, standing at the edge of the surf and laughing, and discovering the water. A good Southern California boy. Reality had another argument.

The first thing was, he hated the swimming diapers. We changed him in our little CR-V’s trunk, in the shade of a little deciduous tree, and he cried for his new diapers and even for the swim trunks and shirt — high on the SPF! — that he’d worn many times. Of course he cried more for the sunscreen we slathered on, as one must with a fair-skinned baby. And he cried while we waited for other cars, slowly cruising in a search for parking, to pass; and then cried as we crossed the street, walked down the short alley, and came to the tawny sand.

Fortunately, he stopped crying when we reached the sand. He even happily walked in it. And, in a moment, he was playing and digging: our vision of a little beach toddler was coming true! He could comfortably walk in sand, and find just the right spot, and he knew how to use his shovel and his bucket, and it enchanted him to move the sand back and forth. Next to us, three college-age girls sunned themselves carefully. Equally carefully, I watched for seashells, or glass, or anything sharp a little barefoot baby could step in. He dug away, oblivious to the patch of gull feathers just next to him, but I moved them to a safer place, feet away, where whatever disease caused them to fall out couldn’t affect the baby.

He picked up his plastic bucket and walked along the beach until he found the perfect spot, sitting and digging in with his little shovel. First he filled his bucket; then he turned it over, and laughed as the sand poured out. Then he filled his bucket again, filling his little shovel to the brim, stabbing it deep into the sand. Unable to lift the shovel, he cried, and I showed him how to take little scoops. He would take a little scoop, and another, and then a medium one, and then the shovel was stuck, again and again; but now he was freeing it.

We walked down to the water and stood at the edge of the wet sand. Our beach toddler was clearly intimidated by the breaking waves, the roar and flash, and he hung back, holding his mother’s hand and asking for me. It being my dadly duty, I stepped off and took some lovely photos. His mom tried to get him to walk into the edge of the surf and let the waves touch his toes, but he was scared and cried “all done, all done!” Sad words from a baby who loves a wading pool or a bath!

So his mother held him close, and let the waves lap around her ankles. My son would point at the water, say “wawa,” and then say “more, more” every time the waves receded. She’d try to lower him down, to touch the water, but he’d lift his legs over the tips of the waves and cry “all done, all done!” again.

After several rounds of this, my wife sat down by the very edge of the surf, so that they could feel the water come in around them, just up to his knees. He held her tight and laughed as the water lapped at his feet and legs and waist. He even began to smile; he was finally getting used to the water.

And then a giant wave came in, towering above the others, and broke over them.

Then there were too many tears to stay at the beach; of course we went home, and cried getting into the car seat, and cried changing a poopy diaper, and even refused the [mum-mum](http://www.mummums.com/toddler-mum-mum/overview/) that was proffered to end the crying.

So then the next trip to the water was of course to the pool, and that was quite different.
