This site is about [me](http://www.kaizendad.com/who-is-wade-armstrong/) and my family. Generally I talk about my experiences as a [daddyblogger](http://www.kaizendad.com). Usually — although not always — I bring it back to [kaizen](http://www.kaizendad.com/what-is-kaizen/). Sometimes you may see politics, product development, and other things that a normal human being may be interested in on this site. If we disagree, I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments.


## About the Photos

There are a lot of photos on this site. Mostly I’ve taken them all. I like to take photos. Hopefully you enjoy them.

I shoot most everything on my iPhone or my [Panasonic GX-1 mirrorless camera](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00604YTFM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00604YTFM&linkCode=as2&tag=wadearmstrong-20). Images are edited either in various iPhone apps or [Lightroom](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CH6ATMO/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=wadearmstrong-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B00CH6ATMO&adid=1JXV5G0KPZK3CZHA35EF&).


## Money and Site Policies

I haven’t written any sponsored posts yet, but if I did, I’d let you know beforehand. I do occasionally drop in an affiliate link when I’m speaking specifically about a product, and I don’t mention that; it’s not that I want to hide anything, but a bunch of “(affiliate link)”s in the text just look bad and make for a bad reading experience. However, I’ll never use an affiliate link that gives you anything more than the lowest price I’m aware of.
