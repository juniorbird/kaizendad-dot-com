There was a time when I wasn’t a dad; while the baby’s just 9 months old. it sure seems a lifetime ago. Back then, my mind turned to other topics, and my blog reflected that. I wrote [funny stories](http://juniorbird.com/archive/004096.html); I did [detailed statistical analyses of political issues](http://juniorbird.com/archive/004066.html); I even told [stories from my youth](http://juniorbird.com/archive/001811.html). But, as we began to consider having a baby, all these topics began to get a little dull. I knew I needed a new story for a new era in my life.

Thus: this blog. And so my old blog languished, unloved, for months. But I knew I wanted to keep it forever (after all, I’d put a ton of love into it, over the years). So I [archived it](http://juniorbird.com/archive/004216.html), and now it’s a happy, static site that can sit safely as a record of how I once was. You know, with the [recipes](http://juniorbird.com/archive/004071.html), the [self-deprecation](http://juniorbird.com/archive/004071.html), the [shocking confessions](http://juniorbird.com/archive/002419.html), and all the [travelogues](http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html).

So, if you want to hear about dad-style, family stuff, then read on here. If you want to know how I was before I was who I am now, may I suggest the story of how [my martini glasses are my love](http://juniorbird.com/archive/003847.html)?
