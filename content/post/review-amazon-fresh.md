I’m a big Amazon fan. We do the Amazon Prime thing, the Amazon Mom thing((my wife signed up for that, since I assume they check gender)), the Amazon Subscribe and Save thing, we’ve got Kindles, I thought, being a busy new parent, Amazon Fresh would come to the rescue. Boy was I wrong! I feel like Amazon is the company that has everything, and has it cheap. Amazon Fresh turned out to have not too much, and at middling prices.
