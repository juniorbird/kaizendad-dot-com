We just got back from our second big flight with the boy in six months — a weekend in the Bay Area. He flew there and back with nary a peep, just as he flew to New York and back a month ago, quiet as a mouse almost the whole way. I’m just an ordinary dad, and my wife, while extraordinary, isn’t some famous baby whisperer. We had a quiet flight with our baby by with a little bit of planning, and these seven Kaizen-inspired tips for flying with your baby.

One of the things that Kaizen focuses on is the concept of *[muri](/glossary#muri)* — usually translated as “overburden.” Kaizen says “don’t ask too much of the parts of your system, both machine and people; stick to the possible and you’ll get good results again and again.” The big key to flying with your baby is to keep this in mind. Don’t ask too much of your baby and also don’t ask too much of **yourself**. Here are 7 tips for flying with your baby that use Kaizen’s general principle of [muri](/glossary#muri):


## 1. Fly at your baby’s best time

This is the most important tip; if you do nothing else, follow this one. Your flight will be easiest if your baby is asleep, so fly when your baby is likely to be asleep. My son is a great nighttime sleeper, can nap ok in the early morning, and won’t nap at all the rest of the day, so we chose to take nighttime flights where possible.

A sleeping baby is actually easy-to-handle; ours was relaxed through security and fell asleep shortly thereafter. He was even able to sleep through takeoff and landing some of the time! The key skill for the baby in all this is not being a heavy sleeper — my boy is actually a light sleeper — it’s being able to get back to sleep. If your baby has that skill (with a little help from you), then this approach is solidly within their capability.

If you can’t fly at a good sleeping time, or your baby is bad at getting back to sleep after being awoken, it’s far better to pick a time when your baby is cheery. Most babies have cycles during the day; try to work with that. My son, for instance, is cranky as heck from 5pm until he’s asleep at 7 or 7:30pm. We made sure our flights were after these hours, and it paid off with an easy-to-handle baby.

Of course, this isn’t always as ideal as possible for mom and dad. For instance, our return flight from the Bay Area was at 7am on Monday instead of Sunday evening, partially so that we could avoid that cranky evening time. A 4:30 wake-up was a small price to pay for a happy traveling baby!


## 2. Check a bag

That’s right, I’m saying you should actually pay the bag fees and add the wait by baggage claim to your trip. But hear me out: if you’re flying with your baby, you’re already burdened with tons of stuff. You’ve got:

- diaper bag
- stroller
- car seat
- bag full of food
- probably some changes of clothes for everyone
- toys
- etc. etc.

That’s a lot to carry. At the very least, it’s going to be 2 carry-on bags more than you ever had to deal with as a couple flying. Sure, you’re entitled to two more carry-ons if you bought a seat for your baby (see below), but the reality is that the number of carry-ons you can handle is a function not just of space but also of how many hands you have.

In the last step of getting on the plane, you’ll have to carry everything in your own two hands, down a narrow aisle, nothing hooked on the back of a stroller to take a load off. Have a carry-on load you can handle during this phase. When we boarded the plane, my wife carried the baby and a diaper bag, and I carried the car seat in one hand and, on my back and in my other hand, a carry-on bag for each of us. Talk about [muri](/glossary#muri); I was at 100% of capacity for fitting through the aisle, but at least I was only at 100%. Yes, that’s worth $50.


## 3. Know what’s coming — be ready for security & boarding

Speaking of steps… there are many along the way to getting on and off a plane. Reduce your stress by being ready for each one.

1. If you’re taking a cab to the airport, make sure the baby’s car seat is ready to be buckled in without a base. (And you’ve practiced doing it! We each buckled the baby’s seat into our cars a couple of times without the base, just to be ready.)
2. When you go through security at a US airport, you’ll have to send everything through. Make sure you’ve packed your baby food in a separate bag you can pull out and put through security on its own; also have your toys off your car seat, since you’ll have to run it through the x-ray upside down and the toys could get caught on the rollers of the conveyor belt (which is probably filthy, anyway!). Yes, I learned this one by getting our baby’s pacifier stuck in the rollers. Fortunately we had a clean one in the diaper bag! It’s well worth pausing before you get to security to get arranged, rather than hurrying up and creating [muri](/glossary#muri) for yourself.
3. As you’re going down the gangway to board, you’ll need to gate check your stroller and, if you haven’t bought baby a seat, your car seat as well. If you don’t have your own gate check bag, make sure to ask for one from the skycap or at check-in; they’ll happily give it. Also make sure that you’ve got both of these tagged properly so that you can pick them up on the gangway exiting the plane, instead of waiting for them at baggage claim. When you reach the end of the boarding ramp, be ready to have the baby out of their stroller (and their car seat, if they’ll be in arms); one parent can board with baby and get them situated, while the other gets the stroller ready for gate check and catches up. After practicing the whole process twice, I was able to do this really quickly on our third and fourth flights, and I have to say I felt pretty slick moving the process along well in front of an audience!
4. As you exit the plane, the process goes in reverse. Know where to expect your gate-checked bags.


## 4. Buy a seat for baby

My second expensive tip. Let me qualify this quickly: I wouldn’t hesitate to keep my son on my lap on a quick flight to San Francisco from Los Angeles, but, for anything much more than that you want to make your life easy. (Keep in mind that you’re buying a seat when you’re flying with a toddler, so it’s not like you can do anything but delay this expense slightly.)

Stewardesses will tell families flying with baby in a car seat to buckle them into the window seat. This is both safe and lovely on any long flight: mom and dad get normal seats that they can enjoy normally, eating dinner on a tray that folds down comfortably, not having baby knock things over, and not having to wake a sleeping baby to go to the bathroom.

We bought a seat for our first trip because it was cross-country, and it was so easy to let the baby sleep and fly normally that I wouldn’t trade this away for anything. Even when I had to hold him for a while, after he woke up on the return flight, it was great to have a place to put him when he finally fell asleep.


## 5. Time your feedings

In general, feeding baby on a schedule is a win for everyone. However, your goals on a flight are different. First of all, feeding during takeoff and landing can reduce ear discomfort from altitude changes, which is a big reason your baby may cry. Try to time feedings to take place at these stages of flight.

If your baby is sleeping well through the flight and starts to wake, you can also feed them a little straight away — that often can put them back to sleep. Don’t be shy to feed baby before they’re really hungry, too; no point in waiting for them to cry!

If you’re feeding formula, like we are, then bringing some ready-to-drink can make your life a lot easier. Portioning out powder and mixing with bottled water can be difficult when strapped into a seat.

I’d heard this tip before we first flew with our baby, and made sure to try it on the cross-country flights. He didn’t seem hungry on the flight up to San Francisco, so I didn’t start feeding him… and then I could see his discomfort, and the tears start to well on climbout. A bottle in his mouth fixed all that, so I know it’s not just a myth. And I feel no guilt that a full baby is quiet, sleeping, and less fussy.


## 6. Be proactive, but don’t be afraid

You’ve been watching your baby for their whole life now; take advantage of that knowledge and aggressively deal with emerging issues before they become serious. Feeding a baby who’s not starving yet is a big piece of this, as above, but so are things like:

- Holding a baby who’s starting to get cranky, before the cranky can start
- Getting a fidgeting baby out of their car seat and onto your lap before the tears start
- Making sure baby has a toy before they can get bored

One of the big advantages of sitting this close to your baby for so long is that you can see these issues before they start, and cut them off straight away!

That said, don’t live in fear — there’s no need for hypervigilance. You don’t need to respond to every little cue; you know your baby and can handle it all. The worst case is just a few tears.

I worried and worried about our baby crying on the plane, and then, the first time he did it, I realized that a six-month-old can barely be heard over the engines anyway. My son woke up and started to cry halfway through a flight from New York to Los Angeles; I just held him, like any other day, and the crying stopped. He fell asleep in my arms. It wasn’t thirty minutes, it wasn’t a whole flight, and it probably wasn’t even five minutes. Nobody looked at me once the whole flight. Your baby crying on a flight isn’t so bad, and you know how to stop it, too.


## 7. Treat yourself when you’re flying with your baby!
