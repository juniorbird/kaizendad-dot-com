We received the dreaded call at about 11:15am on Thursday: “your baby is ok, he’s with the paramedics, they’re taking him to the hospital.” The little one had stopped breathing and turned white at daycare. We rushed to [UCLA Medical Center](http://www.uclahealth.org/homepage_med.cfm) and met… a pink, sleeping baby, cooing as he napped in the hospital bed. Couldn’t have looked healthier. Except for the [Apparent Life-Threatening Event](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1418765-overview#a1) that he’d just suffered.

There’s apparently a name for these things, which is good, because then we know that our baby isn’t the first ever to have this kind of incident. An [ALTE](https://www.pediatriccareonline.org/pco/ub/view/Point-of-Care-Quick-Reference/397132/all/Apparent%20Life-Threatening%20Event) (say “alty”) is apparently a pretty common (less than 10% of infants) incident in which it looks to the caregiver as if the baby will die. But they didn’t, and they usually don’t! So, don’t worry! Go home and treat your baby as if nothing ever happened. In particular, don’t sit up all night starting at him, making sure he’s breathing! OK, bye now!

Seriously, though, the doctors and nurses and hospital staff could not have been any nicer or more helpful. We started out at the UCLA Medical Center, where they checked the boy out and made sure nothing was wrong.
