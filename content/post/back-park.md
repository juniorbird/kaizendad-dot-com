The park: it’s one of the happiest places a kid can think of, filled with green fields and playgrounds and other children to run around with. It’s also a happy place for parents, because what could be better than a tired baby, ready for a nap after a big play at the park? Our neighborhood park is usually an every-weekend destination for me and the baby. But last weekend I had to drag myself there, bringing the baby despite my best instincts — because the last time I’d been there, the baby had fallen, and we’d rushed to Urgent Care.

### A Little Angel, A Daredevil

Let’s face it: my son is fearless. He started out walking — really sturdily and well — at just 9 months. Within a couple of weeks, he was running at top speed. Not once has it occurred to him that he couldn’t climb up something, or walk or run across any kind of uneven or soft ground. He doesn’t even take a lot of tumbles, since he’s strong and coordinated (for an 21-month-old) and can work his way through a lot of problems. He doesn’t stop all day long, and he’s never physically intimidated by any challenge.

At the park, this means that he sees the 5- and 7- and 10-year-olds playing on the big kid equipment, and he wants to play on those too. For each new adventure he wants to try, I stop him and stop him and stop him again, and he keeps going for it, week after week, until I break down or fall a few steps behind, and all of a sudden he’s going down the big slide, whether I want him to or not.

And the reality is that, each time he climbs up that difficult equipment, I feel a little more comfortable, and a little more proud. Climbing up that equipment thirty times also means a good nap, so I may be a little biased there.

Yet it wasn’t this difficult equipment that he fell from, that one day at the park.

### That Day at the Park

We’d come back to the baby section of the park — much to my relief! — because it was almost naptime, and my toddler was getting tired. He ran over himself, a big improvement over the half-dozen times I carry him from something I think is too scary, all the way over to the littlest baby toys on the other side of the park.

What we’d done already  
 When we headed to the park  
 What we’d done at the park  
 When he fell and what he fell off of

The fall  
 What it was like watching him fall  
 I’d been trying to take a picture — because it was such a low thing that his mom could see him on it  
 He was at the bottom and he fell, and because his mother was out of town at a funeral, no less, and I wanted to show her his whole day since he brought her happiness  
 I held him and comforted him and then let him stand  
 And then he fell  
 And then he tried to walk again and again and fell  
 So we rested for a moment and tried again and he fell, because I’ve twisted my ankle a million times  
 So we went to the urgent care

At urgent care  
 The homeless man in the entrance area  
 X-raying a baby is not easy  
 No damage done

Next weekend  
 How do I tire the baby  
 How do I give him a fun day  
 The park!  
 So I had to go back  
 So here we are, doing all his things  
 With extra spotting from me!

And to put it all in perspective  
 The dog had an allergy attack  
 Sneezed so much he hit his head on the concrete and knocked out a tooth  
 Had to go to the emergency vet in the middle of the night with him  
 All the little beings: they need help!
