Let’s face it: for the fire 3 months at least, us dads are really pretty superfluous. Mom can handle everything and is all that’s needed. But here are things we can do to contribute where we can rock it out:

1. Swaddling
2. Diaper Changing
3. Bottle Making
4. Laundry?
5. Mommy Scheduling — what should she do know to feel great?
6. Documenting (photos, videos)
7. Providing some way to sleep — make sure mom gets at least 4 hours 1x/day!
